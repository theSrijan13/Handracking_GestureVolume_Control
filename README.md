# Handtracking Gesture Volume Control
This project demonstrates a hand tracking system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to control the system volume through hand gestures. By tracking the position of your fingers, you can adjust the volume of your computer with simple gestures.

## Features
Hand tracking using MediaPipe.
Gesture recognition for controlling system volume.
Real-time feedback with visual indicators.
Adjustable sensitivity for gesture recognition.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyCaw (Python Core Audio Windows Library)
Numpy
## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handtracking-gesture-volume-control.git
cd handtracking-gesture-volume-control

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
## Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script to start the hand tracking volume control:

python volume_control.py
A window will open displaying the camera feed. Make sure your webcam is properly connected.

### Use the following gestures to control the volume:

Thumb and Index Finger: Adjust the distance between your thumb and index finger to increase or decrease the volume.

## How It Works
The volume_control.py script initializes the webcam feed and uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
The distance between specific landmarks on the hand (thumb and index finger) is calculated to determine the desired volume level.
The PyCaw library is used to interface with the system's audio and adjust the volume accordingly.
Troubleshooting
Ensure your webcam is working and properly connected.
If the hand tracking is not accurate, try adjusting the lighting in your environment.
Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
